Case Study: Expanding our candy brand
Scenario
The Customer purchasing group wants to expand their candy offering. These are store brand candies that we
sell along the brand offerings. The idea is to create a brand new product. The team is discussing
various options at the moment.
Some prefer cookie-based sweets while others think that it should be gummies. The Divisional
Director responsible for purchasing has decided to use a more data-driven approach. He contracted
with a market research group to collect data on products in the market and their characteristics and
customer sentiment.
The market research data is now available and it is your job to find out which product characteristics
drive customer sentiment and subsequently make a recommendation on a new product.
